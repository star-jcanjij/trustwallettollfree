===========================================================

Having trouble with your Trust Wallet? Whether you‚Äôre seeing incorrect balances, failed transactions, missing tokens, or app crashes‚Äîyou're not alone. Many users run into wallet-related issues due to bugs, outdated versions, or misconfigurations.

In this guide, you‚Äôll learn the most common reasons why Trust Wallet might not be working, how to fix it, and how to get expert help. For **instant assistance**, contact **Trust Wallet support** at **+1-870-406-6577** ‚Äî available 24/7 to help with wallet recovery, syncing issues, token display errors, and more.

üö® Common Reasons Why Trust Wallet May Not Work
-----------------------------------------------

Here are a few of the top reasons your wallet may be malfunctioning:

1. **Outdated App Version**  
   Older versions can lead to crashes, lag, or failed transaction confirmations.

2. **Network or Server Issues**  
   Congestion on blockchains like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) can delay transactions or hide updated balances.

3. **Wrong Network or Token Settings**  
   Sending assets to an unsupported blockchain or address format may cause them not to show up in your wallet.

4. **Device or App Cache Problems**  
   Accumulated cache or conflicting apps may cause performance issues.

5. **Connectivity Errors**  
   Trust Wallet needs a stable internet connection. WiFi or mobile data disruptions may interfere with balance syncing.

If you‚Äôre still experiencing problems, it‚Äôs best to speak with a live support specialist at **+1-870-406-6577**.

üîß How to Fix Trust Wallet Issues
---------------------------------

Try the following steps to fix common Trust Wallet errors:

‚úÖ **Step 1: Update the App**  
   Visit the **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store** and install the latest version of Trust Wallet.

‚úÖ **Step 2: Reboot Your Device**  
   Restart your phone to resolve minor background conflicts.

‚úÖ **Step 3: Clear Cache or Reinstall**  
   On Android:  
   Go to *Settings > Apps > Trust Wallet > Storage > Clear Cache*  
   On iOS:  
   Uninstall and reinstall the app (your funds are safe as long as your seed phrase is backed up).

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Always **back up your 12-word recovery phrase** before making any changes to the app.

‚úÖ **Step 4: Use Blockchain Explorers**  
   Use tools like **Etherscan** or **BscScan** to verify whether your transaction has been confirmed.

If the tokens appear on the blockchain but not in your app, it‚Äôs just a **display issue**, not a loss of funds.
